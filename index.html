          <h1>ANNOUNCEMENT</h1>

<p>Unfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.</p>

<p>I will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.</p>

<p>It is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.</p>

<p>Okay, I'll also take <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA">PayPal</a></p>

<hr><h1>Welcome to the Pseudonym Matching Windows Application.</h1>

<h2>The problem was:</h2>

<p>Data comes in that contains possible duplicates. The name Richard can also be Rich, Richie, Ricky, Richy, Rick, Dick and possibly a million others.</p>

<h2>The solution:</h2>

<p>Well I would normally have put all this in a Microsoft SQL Server database, but MSSQL 2012 was broken on my machine and I don't have time to rebuild it at the moment. It's falling apart, so the tape and elastic bands will have to hold a little longer.</p>

<p>You import the CSV you are sent that should be in the format</p>

<p>Name,Gender,Occurance</p>

<p>The occurance is ignored, as it holds no value for me.</p>

<p>Now you import the pseudonyms CSV in the format:</p>

<p>Basename,Pseudonyms</p>

<p>The pseudonyms are pipe seperated (|).</p>

<p>The pseudonyms can be changed in the Modify form, the original file is loaded into the datagridview and can be added to, altered and deleted. You can then save to a new CSV.</p>
