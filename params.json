{"name":"Pseudonym Matching","tagline":"","body":"ANNOUNCEMENT\r\n============\r\n\r\nUnfortunately my computer has died and due to a lack of continous employment over the recent months I am currently unable to purchase a replacement machine at this point.\r\n\r\nI will therefore no longer be developing this software until I am able to purchase a replacement.\r\n\r\nIt is always a little rude to ask for donations, but as I am developing this software free of charge for everyone to use. I will therefore be accepting donations towards the purchase of a new machine.\r\n\r\nBTC: [1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx](bitcoin:1CdzakhzxS5QMfe9bM6KZapNWbFtfNKimx) | TRC: [1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG](terracoin:1HgyXPsAhyD6wCGqp5Ntgq8549XkWTauvG) | LTC: [LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5](litecoin:LRqjHkL5wFt9JxE5vmHGcxNCbqQMvyEJY5)\r\n\r\nOkay, I'll also take [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=G2M23XDAB8HBA)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Pseudonym Matching Windows Application.\r\n======================================================\r\n\r\nThe problem was:\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nData comes in that contains possible duplicates. The name Richard can also be Rich, Richie, Ricky, Richy, Rick, Dick and possibly a million others.\r\n\r\nThe solution:\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nWell I would normally have put all this in a Microsoft SQL Server database, but MSSQL 2012 was broken on my machine and I don't have time to rebuild it at the moment. It's falling apart, so the tape and elastic bands will have to hold a little longer.\r\n\r\nYou import the CSV you are sent that should be in the format\r\n\r\nName,Gender,Occurance\r\n\r\nThe occurance is ignored, as it holds no value for me.\r\n\r\nNow you import the pseudonyms CSV in the format:\r\n\r\nBasename,Pseudonyms\r\n\r\nThe pseudonyms are pipe seperated (|).\r\n\r\nThe pseudonyms can be changed in the Modify form, the original file is loaded into the datagridview and can be added to, altered and deleted. You can then save to a new CSV.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
